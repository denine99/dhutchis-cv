  abstract = {One of the key challenges in causal inference is coping with data
	uncertainty. In order to generate accurate causal structures and
	parameters, we must develop belief systems that account for incorrect,
	incomplete and outdated data.
	
	Our solution is to assign less weight to uncertain values, so that
	conclusions like conditional independence are weaker when based on
	error-prone measurements instead of reliable ones. We propose a new
	approach based on second order probability distributions (SOPDs)
	and Bayesian updating to allow observation-specific uncertainty levels
	that can be determined through background knowledge (e.g. device
	error rates, logs) and experiment (multiple variable measurements).
	
	This extended abstract highlights the motivation and theory behind
	SOPDs, with a hand example applying them to blood glucose data discretization
	for better inference. Future work will implement the SOPD model on
	actual diabetic physiological data and detail the theoretical and
	practical implications of SOPDs.},
